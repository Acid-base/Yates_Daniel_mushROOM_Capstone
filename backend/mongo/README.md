## Database

The database for this project is MongoDB. MongoDB is a document-oriented database known for its flexibility and scalability. We chose MongoDB for its ease of use, powerful querying features, and ability to handle large amounts of data.

### Setup

1.  **Install MongoDB:**  If you don't have MongoDB installed, follow the instructions for your operating system at [https://www.mongodb.com/try/download](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download).

2.  **Start MongoDB:** Once installed, start the MongoDB server using the command `mongod`.

3.  **Create a Database:**  Open a MongoDB shell by typing `mongo`. Create the database named 'mushroom_app' using the following command:
    ```bash
    use mushroom_app
    ```

### Data Structures

The database consists of the following collections:

- **Observations:** This is the core collection for our mushroom data. Each document within this collection represents an observation of a mushroom.

  ```json
  {
    _id: ObjectId,
    location: String,
    when: Date,
    mushroom_species: String,
    substrate: String,
    notes: String
  }
_id: A unique identifier generated by MongoDB for each observation.
location: A string representing the location of the observation.
when: A Date object representing the date and time of the observation.
mushroom_species: The scientific name of the mushroom observed.
substrate: The type of surface on which the mushroom was found (e.g., wood, soil).
notes: Additional notes about the observation.
Using Mongoose
We use Mongoose as an ORM to interact with MongoDB. Here's an example of the Mongoose schema for the Observations collection:

const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

const observationSchema = new Schema({
  location: String,
  when: Date,
  mushroom_species: String,
  substrate: String,
  notes: String
});

const Observation = mongoose.model('Observation', observationSchema);
Database Scripts
The following scripts are included in this directory:

setup.js: This script sets up the database and creates the Observations collection.

const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const Observation = require('./models/Observation'); // Your Observation model

// Connect to MongoDB
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/mushroom_app', {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true
});

// Create the Observations collection
Observation.createCollection((err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error creating collection:', err);
  } else {
    console.log('Observations collection created successfully.');
  }
});
seed.js: This script populates the Observations collection with sample data.

const Observation = require('./models/Observation'); 

const observations = [
  // ... your sample observation data ...
];

Observation.insertMany(observations)
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Observations seeded successfully.');
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error('Error seeding observations:', err);
  });
Database Interaction
Here are some examples of how to interact with the database:

1. Inserting an observation:

db.observations.insertOne({
  location: "Central Park, New York City",
  when: ISODate("2023-10-27T12:00:00Z"),
  mushroom_species: "Agaricus bisporus",
  substrate: "Soil",
  notes: "Found near a large oak tree." 
});
2. Querying for observations:

db.observations.find({ mushroom_species: "Agaricus bisporus" });
3. Updating an observation:

db.observations.updateOne({ _id: ObjectId("your_observation_id") }, { $set: { notes: "Updated notes." } });
4. Deleting an observation:

db.observations.deleteOne({ _id: ObjectId("your_observation_id") });
Tools
We use MongoDB Compass to visualize and manage the database. You can download it from https://www.mongodb.com/try/download.

Error Handling
We implement robust error handling in our Mongoose code. Errors are caught and logged to a file for debugging.
