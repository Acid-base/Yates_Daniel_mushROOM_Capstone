Create a React hook called `useCounter` that provides the following functionality:

- **State:**
    - `count`: An integer representing the current count, initialized to 0.
- **Functions:**
    - `increment()`: Increments the `count` by 1.
    - `decrement()`: Decrements the `count` by 1.
    - `reset()`: Resets the `count` to 0.

**Output:**

Provide the React hook code in a well-formatted JavaScript file. Ensure the code follows best practices for React hooks, including:

- Using the `useState` hook to manage the `count` state.
- Returning an object containing the `count` state and the `increment`, `decrement`, and `reset` functions.
- Providing clear and concise documentation for the hook.
