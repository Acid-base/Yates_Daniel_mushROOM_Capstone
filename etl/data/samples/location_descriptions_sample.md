| 2 | 12 | 1 | NULL | NULL | NULL | NULL | This is a gated community called "Buttonwood Bay Condominiums" at milepost 96, and I've included a tract of land (owned by the state, I believe) just to the southwest ("over the fence").  The community is heavily forested with tropical hardwood hammock, and the land "over the fence" is all pristine hammock, as well.  It is on the bay side, including a narrow margin of mangroves along the water.  Forest is dominated by gumbo limbo (_Bursera simarouba_), oysterwood (_Gymnanthes lucida_), spanish and white stopped (_Eugenia foetida_ and _E. axillaris_), dogwood (_Piscidia piscipula_), mahogany (_Swietenia mahogoni_), pigeon plum (_Coccoloba diversifolia_), and strongbark (_Bourreria succulenta_). | NULL |
| 3 | 13 | 1 |  | This is a hammock located on south Key Largo shortly before the Overseas highway turns on its way into Tavernier.  There's a nice plot on the ocean side with a big fence and grassy area with sign and everything, and a little farther southwest there's another plot on the bay side.  I include an additional area farther down-key on the ocean side accessible behind a sign talking about a old dump which leads to a large open area with a large man-made "lake". | The bay side is hammock blending rapidly into coastal buttonwood scrub with a narrow zone of mangroves along the water.\n\nThe ocean side has a large buffer of lush hardwood hammock, followed by a strip of rockland (a highly unusual community on the keys, the legacy of some sort of development from the early 1900's maybe?), and then a very broad mangrove zone that terminates finally in the eponymous Dove Creek (it might continue beyond the creek, but I've never ventured over there). | Airplants (_Tillandsia_ spp.) and lichens (_Ramalina_, _Heterodermia_, _Leptogium_) abound in the open, well-ventillated, periodically inundated buttonwood scrub on the bay side.  It might benefit from enrichment from the neighboring bird sanctuary, as well.\n\nSimilar species can be found in the rockland strip on the ocean side, as well, but less abundantly.  This is also the location of the only _Cladonia_ I've seen on any of the Keys (_C. parasitica_ on old weathered buttonwood log).\n\nThe hammock is dominated by poisonwood (_Metopium toxiferum_), spanish stopper (_Eugenia foetida_), dogwood (_Piscidia piscipula_), gumbo limbo (_Busera simarouba_), black ironwood (_Krugiodendron ferrum_), and buttonwood (_Conocarpus erectus_).\n\nThe rockland is mostly buttonwood and Christmas berry (_Lycium carolinianum_). | Rockland / dwarf mangrove forest near the old dump:\n\ntable(noborder).\n| !image 640/144100! | !image 320/144101! | |  |
| 4 | 14 | 1 | NULL | NULL | NULL | NULL | This is also called the Dagney Johnson Key Largo Hammocks State Park or something absurdly long like that.  It is a popular spot on the ocean side just past where the overseas highway veers off and heads for the mainland.  There's a little parking lot right on the side of the road.  It is the location of an illegal development that was nearly finished several decades ago (I guess they didn't grease quite enough hands!).  It contains a large amount of lush tropical hardwood hammock (some of the finest still in existence on the "mainland" US), coastal buttonwood scrub, mangrove, and rocklands (from quaries used to build the development).  All the usual species, but a particularly good place to find lancewood (_Ocotea coriacea_) and willow bustic (_Sideroxylon salicifolia_). | NULL |
| 5 | 18 | 1 | NULL | NULL | NULL | NULL | Expanded area to include all of Moran State Park.  This was original set to:\n\nNorth: 48.67\nWest: -122.837\nEast: -122.837\nSouth: 48.67\n\nwhich is inside the park somewhat off center. | NULL |
